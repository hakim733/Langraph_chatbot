# 🤖 LangGraph Chatbot with Groq & Gemma 2

This project showcases a **high-performance chatbot** built using [LangGraph](https://docs.langchain.com/langgraph/), [Groq](https://groq.com/), and [Google’s Gemma 2 9B It](https://ai.google.dev/gemma) model. It combines **graph-based state management**, **ultra-fast LLM inference**, and **real-time tracing** to create a flexible, scalable conversational agent.

## 🚀 What’s Inside

This chatbot leverages:

- **LangGraph** – a powerful framework for building AI applications with structured graph workflows. It allows the chatbot to maintain state, manage control flow, and scale to complex multi-step or multi-agent conversations.
- **Groq** – delivers industry-leading inference speed by running the Gemma 2 9B It model on Groq’s high-performance LPU (Language Processing Unit) hardware.
- **LangSmith** – adds visibility into the runtime by enabling full tracing, debugging, and performance monitoring of the language model's behavior.

Together, these tools create a seamless and efficient development experience for building next-generation LLM apps.

## 💡 Key Features

- **Real-time chatbot** using Gemma 2 with Groq’s API  
- **LangGraph architecture** for clean, modular state control  
- **Persistent message history** using `add_messages` pattern  
- **LangSmith tracing** for observability and prompt debugging  
- **Visual graph rendering** for understanding conversation flow  
- Fully extensible for **multi-agent**, **tool-based**, or **chain-aware** logic

## 🌐 Use Cases

- Smart customer support agents  
- LLM-powered tutors or assistants  
- Modular, stateful AI workflows  
- Prototyping fast-response chat interfaces  
- Graph-native LLM experimentation

## 📌 Project Vision

The goal of this project is to show how modern LLM infrastructure can be combined to build **responsive, traceable, and extensible AI systems** — all with just a few lines of Python. This design is intended to scale beyond simple chatbots into full AI orchestration workflows, leveraging the speed of Groq, the flexibility of LangGraph, and the transparency of LangSmith.
